I worked in the Research, Development & Innovation (RSI) department of Arethusa Srl. I participated in the implementation of three Research Projects financed by the Campania Region and MISE: ReASSET, DIGGERly and CADS.
In DIGGERly and CADS projects I participated in the creation of smart Android apps with both Kotlin and Dart languages.
For all these projects I contributed to:
• Development of web, desktop and mobile software using different programming languages/platforms/technologies;
• Collaboration with development and design teams to ensure product quality;
• Requirements analysis and solution design;
• Drafting of technical documentation.

GitHub has all the projects and applications I've developed since the beginning of my career as a software developer. My experience started with the creation of PWA (Progressive Web Application) using JavaScript and TypeScript languages with framework React.js, with backend developed in Node.js with Express.js. Later I expanded my field of expertise in the area of Android development using its native language Kotlin. At first, I created applications with a UI based on the XML Layouts and then adopted the Jetpack Compose toolkit, which I use for my Android application development. In addition, in order to cover multi-platform mobile development, I have extended my skills to Dart and Flutter for the development of mobile apps for Android and multi-platform.
